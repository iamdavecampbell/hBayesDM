data_columns:
  subjID: A unique identifier for each subject in the data-set.
  prob: Objective probability of the variable lottery.
  ambig: Ambiguity level of the variable lottery (0 for risky lottery; greater than
    0 for ambiguous lottery).
  reward_var: Amount of reward in variable lottery. Assumed to be greater than zero.
  reward_fix: Amount of reward in fixed lottery. Assumed to be greater than zero.
  choice: If the variable lottery was selected, choice == 1; otherwise choice == 0.
