- Remove dependence on the modeest package. Now use a built-in function to estimate the mode of a posterior distribution.
- Rewrite the "printFit" function.

Jan 20, 2017 (0.3.0)
- Made several changes following the guidelines for R packages providing interfaces to Stan. 
- Stan models are precompiled and models will run immediately when called. 
- The default number of chains is set to 4. 
- The default value of `adapt_delta` is set to 0.95 to reduce the potential for divergences.
- The “printFit” function uses LOOIC by default. Users can select WAIC or both (LOOIC & WAIC) if needed.

  * Change a link to its tutorial website

Dec 21, 2016 (0.2.3.2)
1. Change
  * Use wide normal distributions for unbounded parameters (gng_* models).
  * Automatic removal of rows (trials) containing NAs. 

Sep 29, 2016 (0.2.3.1)
1. Change
  * Add a function for plotting individual parameters (plotInd) 

Sat July 16 2016 (0.2.3)
1. Change
  * Add a new task: the Ultimatum Game
  * Add new models for the Probabilistic Reversal Learning and Risk Aversion tasks
  * ‘bandit2arm’ -> change its name to ‘bandit2arm_delta’. Now all model names are in the same format (i.e., TASK_MODEL).
  * Users can extract model-based regressors from gng_m* models
  * Include the option of customizing control parameters (adapt_delta, max_treedepth, stepsize)
  * ‘plotHDI’ function -> add ‘fontSize’ argument & change the color of histogram

Sat Apr 02 2016 (0.2.1)
